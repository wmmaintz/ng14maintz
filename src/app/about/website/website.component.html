                <h4>Responsive Design</h4>
                <p>
                    This website was constructed with HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript to achieve a "responsive design" and was built upon an Angular Single-Page Application (SPA) framework.  It also employs Twitter's bootstrap which is "the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web."  Additionally, Angular Material was utilized to standarize some of the components and color theme used in the UI design and presentation.  This allows the website to be viewed on multiple devices, from large desktop screens to mobile devices like tablets and smartphones.  The cascading style sheets were created using SCSS, a pre-compiler for generating Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) files, and all menu items and social media links utilize the Angular Material Icons.

                <h4>Single Page Application</h4>
                <p>This website uses a Single Page Application design, meaning that all content is presented using a single HTML file as its base and sections of that base page are swapped in and out or replaced by other content that the user has selected to see.  This eliminates the need to repaint the entire screen in order to load multiple HTML pages everytime the user moves from one page to another.  Using the Angular framework allows this website to take the standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and extend it, employing a Model-View-Whatever design, including dependency injection, directives, two-way data binding, controllers, services, filters, helpers, and interceptors.</p>

                <h4>Development Automation</h4>
                <p>This website was developed, constructed and compiled using some build automation 
                tools like Node, Bower, Yeoman, Grunt, Gulp, and Less.  Node.js® is a JavaScript 
                runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm,
                is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.</p>  
                <p>Bower manages components that contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, fonts or image files.  
                Bower simply installs the right versions of the packages one needs and as well as 
                their dependencies.</p> 
                <p>Yeoman is a scaffolding tool to quickly populate the base system website, readying 
                it for further custom development.</p>
                <p>Both Grunt and Gulp are tools used in developing websites by watching for changes
                in files and then rebuilding and redisplaying the website immediately based on those 
                changes.  Either can be used to reduce the development and testing time and 
                particularly when needing to test a website on multiple devices.</p>
                <p>The Less compiler provides the developer with an increased versatility
                in the creation of Cascading Style Sheets.</p>

                <h4>Test Automation &amp; Test-Driven Development</h4>
                <p>This website was developed, constructed and compiled using some test automation 
                tools like Karma for unit-testing and Protractor for end-to-end testing.  Every time 
                a change was made to the underlying code, a series of unit tests were executed 
                automatically, thereby providing immediate feedback to the developer as to whether 
                or not the newly created code worked.  Protractor, Jasmine, Karma, PhantomJS, Mocha,  
                and Chai were all used to perform the automated tests.</p>
                <p>Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for AngularJS applications.  Protractor 
                runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as 
                a user would.</p>
                <p>Jasmine is a behavior-driven development framework for testing JavaScript code.  It 
                does not depend on any other JavaScript frameworks. It does not require a DOM. And it 
                has a clean, obvious syntax so that you can easily write tests.</p>
                <p>Karma (formerly Testacular) is a JavaScript command line tool that can be used to
                spawn a web server which loads the application's source code and executes tests against
                that source code. Karma can be configured to run against a number of different browsers, 
                which is useful for being confident that the application works on all browsers that need
                to be supported.</p>
                <p>Mocha is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the 
                browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing
                for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct 
                test cases.</p>
                <p>Chai is a BDD / TDD Assertion Library for node and the browser that can be 
                delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.</p>
